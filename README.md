# Social Network API

## Description
This Social Network web application can be used for users to share their thoughts, react to friend's thoughts, and create friend lists. This application uses a MongoDB for a NoSQL database to handle the large amounts of data. This application also uses express.js for routing by performing Get, Post, Put, & Delete routes to the API via Insomnia.
